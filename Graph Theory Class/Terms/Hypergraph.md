#graph 
A type of [[Graph]] where the [[Edge|edges]] are just arbitrary sets of the [[Vertex|vertices]].
Instead of only having two [[Vertex|vertices]] per [[Edge]] we can have up to the amount of [[Vertex|vertices]] in the graph included as an [[Edge]]

## Example
For the elements:
`V = {a,b,c,d,e}`
`E = {{a,b,c}, {a,b}, {c,d,e}, {d,e}}`
